## Method

00:00 - Add oil to a braiser with garlic and basil. Simmer \~3 minutes until basil is wilted. Optional: add chili flake. Let garlic get a bit of color if desired.
03:00 – Remove garlic and basil. Blend with 60 ml oil (reserve remainder) — blitz for 30 seconds.
03:30 – In the same pan, place halved onion cut-side down to sear. Add butter and cook until browned — about 5 minutes.
08:30 – Get pasta water going in a separate pot. Salt once boiling (\~30 sec setup).
09:00 – Add tomatoes to the pan. Crush lightly with a spoon. Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.
24:00 – 15 minutes into tomato simmering, drop pasta into boiling water. Cook \~2 minutes shy of package instructions.
29:00 – After 20 minutes of sauce time, discard the onion. Add the garlic/basil mash to the sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes.
34:00 – Use tongs to transfer pasta straight from pot to sauce. Stir vigorously to coat and emulsify. Add pasta water as needed until sauce is glossy and clings — \~5 minutes.
39:00 – Plate by twirling pasta with a ladle into a bowl. Finish with a drizzle of reserved infused oil, rubbed basil, and a generous spoon of muddica atturrata.
