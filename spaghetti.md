## Method

1. 00:00 - Start pasta water on high (lid on). In a braiser, combine oil, garlic, basil (plus chili flake if using). Simmer ~3 minutes until basil wilts.  
2. 03:00 - Remove garlic and basil. Blend with 2 tbsp of oil until smooth - ~30 sec blitz.  
3. 03:30 - In the same pan, place halved onion cut-side down, add butter. Brown for ~5 minutes.  
4. 04:00 - In a small skillet, start muddica: toast panko + minced garlic in oil, stir occasionally.  
5. 08:30 - Add tomatoes to butter/onion pan. Crush with spoon. Simmer covered for 20 minutes.
6. 09:00 - Finish muddica: stir in parsley, season with salt & pepper, then remove from heat and set aside.  
7. 10:00 - Salt pasta water and drop in pasta. Cook ~2 min less than package time.  
8. 20:00 - Discard onion. Stir in garlic/basil mash. Simmer 3–5 minutes more.  
9. 23:00 - Transfer pasta directly from pot to sauce with tongs. Stir and toss vigorously to coat. Add pasta water as needed for glossy sauce — ~4–5 minutes.  
10. 28:00 - [Plate by twirling pasta with a ladle into bowl](https://youtu.be/SsUGomHw85o?t=1131). Top with reserved infused oil, rubbed basil, and muddica atturrata.
